## Background

Turing patterns were introduced by Alan Turing in 1952 to describe the way patterns can arise naturally out of a uniform state. Reaction-diffusion theories of morphogenesis have served as important models in theoretical biology, as patterns such as hexagons, spirals and stripes are found as solutions of Turing-like reaction-diffusion equations. 

The parameters will depend on the physical system under consideration: for example, in fish skin pigmentation, the associated equation is a three-field reaction-diffusion where the linear parameters are associated with pigmentation cell concentration and the diffusion parameters are not the same for all fields. 

As well as in biological systems, Turing patterns occur in other natural systems, for example, the wind patterns formed in sand.

## Our Aim

We are aiming to create a PDE solver used to generate Turing patterns. We are also working to implement optimisers and MCMC methods to recover the distributions of parameters associated with data generated by a Turing reation-diffusion system.
